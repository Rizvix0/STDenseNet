# Basic operation
> This is the code for "Citywide Cellular Traffic Prediction Based on Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks".

Users can run "demo_densenet.py" to train the model and the results will be generated and stored in the reporsitory.

If you just want to see the prediction reseults without time to run the code, you can simply run "run_prediction.py", and you will also obtain the results.
